The goal of this project was to create a simple website containing: a homepage with links to each recipe page and three recipe pages each with headings, a picture, an ordered list, and an unordered list. 

I found this project to be easy and mainly time consuming. 

The two mistakes I made were putting my headings, links, and list items within quotes thinking that they needed to be, and not adding each link item to it's own paragraph for clarity.
